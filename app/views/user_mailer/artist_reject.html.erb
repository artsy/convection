            <p>Thank you for submitting your work to Artsy.</p>
            <p>Currently we do not work with artists directly. If you are represented by a gallery that would be interested in partnering with Artsy, please encourage the gallery to visit this page.</p>
            <p>If you do not currently have gallery representation, we would like to bring to your attention our Gallery Representation Guide and The Working Artistâ€™s Guide, two resources put together by our Editorial team. </p>
            <p>We hope this information is helpful and that you continue to explore Artsy!</p>
            <p>Thank you,</p>
            <p>Artsy</p>
