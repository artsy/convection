            <p>Thank you for submitting your work to Artsy.</p>
            <p>After extensive research, we are unable to find a record of the artwork and attribute it to the style of painting. We are therefore unable to offer it for sale through Artsy at this time.</p>
            <p>Should you have any other works of art you wish to sell with Artsy we would be happy to assist.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at consign@artsymail.com</p>
            <p>Thank you,</p>
            <p>Artsy</p>
