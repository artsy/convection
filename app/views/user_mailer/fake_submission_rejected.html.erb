            <p>After extensive research, we were unable to verify this artwork and attribute it to the artist. Therefore, we cannot offer this work for sale through Artsy.</p>
            <p>Should you have other works of art you wish to sell with Artsy, we would be happy to assist. You can submit another artwork anytime.</p>
            <p>
              Sincerely,
              <br />
