            <p>Thank you for submitting your work to <%= link_to 'Artsy', 'https://www.artsy.net', target: :_blank %>.</p>
            <p>After extensive research, we are unable to find a record of the artwork and attribute it to the artist. We are therefore unable to offer it for sale through Artsy at this time.</p>
            <p>Should you have any other works of art you wish to sell with Artsy we would be happy to assist.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at <%= link_to 'consign@artsymail.com', 'mailto:consign@artsymail.com', target: :_blank %></p>
            <p>Thank you,</p>
