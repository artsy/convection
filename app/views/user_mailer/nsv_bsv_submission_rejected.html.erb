            <p>Thank you for submitting your work to Artsy.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this artwork would fall below our auction threshold and therefore would not be suitable for a sale at Artsy. 
              Should you have any other works of art you wish to sell with Artsy we would be happy to assist. </p>
            <p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at consign@artsymail.com</p> //TODO: add link
            <p>Thank you,</p>
